# Poison-NOF

This page presents the results of the Piris Natural Orbital Functionals (PNOF) benchmarked within the [Poison Set (P30)](https://doi.org/10.1039/D2CP00268J). This benchmark consist on the 30 most challenging reactions to reproduce with density functional approximations (DFAs), identified from the [GMTKN55](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7CP04913G) benchmark. 

The P30 benchmark has three sets:

- **P30-5**: The 30 most difficult reactions with molecules formed by at most 5 atoms.
- **P30-10**: The 30 most difficult reactions with molecules formed by at most 10 atoms.
- **P30-20**: The 30 most difficult reactions with molecules formed by at most 20 atoms.

By studying the performance of the current Natural Orbital Functinals, we aim to point out its capabilities to address the current challenges of electronic structure methods.

```{admonition} Availavility of data
:class: warning
The current webpage only present the results of **P30-5**.

The **def2-QZVP** basis set has been used for all the calculations.

Calculations were performed using [DoNOF software](https://github.com/DoNOF/DoNOFsw)
