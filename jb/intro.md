# Slim-NOF

This page presents the results of the Piris Natural Orbital Functionals (PNOF) benchmarked within the [Slim Set (Slim)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00512). This benchmark consist on the 100 reactions to reproduce the results of [GMTKN55](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7CP04913G) benchmark. 

The Slim benchmark has three sets:

- **Slim05**: The 100 reactions with molecules formed by at most 5 atoms that reproduce the results of GMTKN55.
- **Slim16**: The 100 reactions with molecules formed by at most 16 atoms that reproduce the results of GMTKN55.
- **Slim20**: The 100 reactions with molecules formed by at most 20 atoms that reproduce the results of GMTKN55.

By studying the performance of the current Natural Orbital Functinals, we aim to point out its capabilities to address the current challenges of electronic structure methods.

:class: warning
The current webpage only present the results of **Slim05**.

The **def2-QZVP** basis set has been used for all the calculations.

Calculations were performed using [DoNOF software](https://github.com/DoNOF/DoNOFsw)
